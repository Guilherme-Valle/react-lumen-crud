# react-lumen-crud

** I'm developing this project to make a kind of model project with modern frameworks: React on the front end, Lumen on the back end. This will help me and maybe others who eventually
will need to develop a CRUD quickly. **

To run this project you will need Composer and npm, and run `composer install` on back-end project and `npm install` on front-end project; after that, run the server of
each application, config .env file of back-end project and the database.
